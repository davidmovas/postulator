# Status

The handoff point between sessions. Read this first.

**Branch:** `rewrite/v2`, cut from `dev`. **Target release:** `v2.0.0`.

## Where we are

**Phase 0 is complete and reviewed.** Tasks 0.1 through 0.10 are done, one commit per
task. The review ran on 2026-09-17: `task build`, `go vet ./...`, `golangci-lint run`
(v2.13.2, 0 issues), `go test -race -cover ./...` and `go run ./cmd/covergate` are all
green, the built binary opens its window, and the dependency rule was re-verified by
planting a domain package that imports squirrel directly and again through
`kernel/paging` — both were caught. Module coverage is 94.67%; every kernel package is
at or above 95.9%.

The fixes the review asked for landed on 2026-09-17 and are listed under Decisions
below.

**Phase 1A (infrastructure) is complete.** The plan is
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-17-phase-1a-sqlite-secrets.md`; its sixteen tasks landed
one commit each. `internal/adapters/sqlite` holds the encrypted store, the embedded goose
migrations, the unit of work, the test helper and the settings and secrets repositories;
`internal/adapters/secrets` holds DPAPI, AES-GCM and the master key; `internal/app` opens
and closes the whole thing at startup. `go build`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint run` (0
issues), `go test -race -covermode=atomic ./...`, `go run ./cmd/covergate` and
`task build` are green, and the built binary starts, writes
`%APPDATA%\Postulator\master.key` and an adiantum-encrypted `postulator.db` whose first
bytes are not the SQLite magic header. Module coverage is 92.50%; every package this
phase added is at or above 87.2%.

**1A reviewed: approved, 2026-09-17.** The independent review re-ran the full gate and
probed the unit of work, the DSN and the recovery path; the four findings it raised landed
in `0eafaa3`, `922a831`, `d190c30` and `055d35e`. Module coverage is 92.55% of 1221
statements.

**Phase 1B (the Wails contracts spike) runs in parallel** in a separate worktree on
`phase-1b`: v3 errors, events and generics, then the open sections of
`docs/CONTRACTS.md`. Phase 2 follows.

## What landed in Phase 0

- The v1.6.2 codebase is gone: `internal/`, `pkg/`, `frontend/`, `main.go`, `Makefile`,
  `scripts/`, `wails.json` and `go.sum`. Kept: git history, the release workflow, the
  build icons, the sitemap import samples and the module path.
- A Wails v3 skeleton that builds and runs. `task build` produces `bin/postulator.exe`,
  the window opens, and `HealthService.Ping` returns the ldflags-injected version.
- The full kernel: `errors`, `paging`, `id`, `clock`, `ctx`, `dto`, `log`, `settings`,
  `middleware`, all test-first, all at or above 95% statement coverage.
- `internal/app/deps_test.go` enforcing the dependency rule, with absent trees skipped.
- `.golangci.yml`, `lefthook.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on windows-latest, and
  `cmd/covergate`. `release.yml` now builds with `task build` and publishes `v2.*` tags,
  marking a tag with a hyphen as a prerelease.
- The docs in this directory, plus the verbatim spec and roadmap under
  `docs/superpowers/`.

## Decisions taken in Phase 0

- **UUIDs come from the standard library.** Go 1.27 ships a `uuid` package (RFC 9562).
  `github.com/google/uuid` is not a dependency. `kernel/id.Valid` does its own canonical
  v4 check because `uuid.Parse` also accepts braced, URN and unhyphenated text and any
  version.
- **`Cut` is a `Keyset` method**, not the free function the spec sketched. The value and
  id accessors already live on the keyset, and passing them again per call is the one
  way to make a cursor disagree with the query that produced it.
- **`kernel/ctx` exposes `ActorFrom`**, not `Actor`: `Actor` is the type name the domain
  uses for `Run.CreatedBy`, so the getter could not share it.
- **`kernel/dto` does not import `kernel/paging`.** It keeps its own limit constants and
  a test asserts the two agree. Importing paging would drag squirrel into the closure of
  everything that touches a DTO, including domain.
- **The Wails template is `vanilla`**, not `vanilla-ts`; beta.23 renamed it. It is still
  Vanilla + TypeScript + Vite.
- **No comments in `.golangci.yml`.** The repository rule forbidding comments in YAML
  won over the plan's request for an inline rationale per tuned rule. The rationales are
  in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`errors.Wrap` returns `error`, not `*Error`.** Returning the concrete pointer meant
  `Wrap(nil, ...)` handed back a typed nil that is not nil once it is returned as an
  `error`, and `CodeOf` then dereferenced it. `Error`, `Unwrap`, `Is`, `CodeOf` and
  `Stack` are nil-receiver safe as well. Enrichment chains now start from `New(...)`,
  which cannot be nil.
- **The kernel exports nothing that only its own tests call.** `errors.Codes`,
  `errors.RetryAfter`, `paging.Order.String` and `log.RedactedKeys` are gone, and
  `SortKey.Literal` is unexported as `literal` per the spec, with its table test moved
  in-package.
- **`@wailsio/runtime` is pinned to `3.0.0-beta.23`**, matching the CLI tag, and the
  build task runs `npm ci` against the committed lockfile rather than `npm install`.
- **covergate cross-checks the filesystem.** If `internal/domain` or
  `internal/application` holds a non-test `.go` file but the profile reports no
  statements for it, the gate fails instead of reporting itself skipped. That is the
  case a narrowed `go test` package list would otherwise hide.
- **Vite writes unhashed asset names with `emptyOutDir` off**, so the committed
  `frontend/dist/.gitkeep` survives a build. Without it `go build ./...` fails on a
  fresh clone, because `frontend/assets.go` embeds a directory the frontend build has
  not created yet.

## Decisions taken in Phase 1A

- **Two pools over one file.** A writer `*sql.DB` capped at one connection with
  `_txlock=immediate`, and a reader `*sql.DB` opened `mode=ro` with four connections. One
  pool capped at a single connection would serialise reads behind long writes; an
  uncapped pool would let two goroutines both begin write transactions and turn WAL's
  single-writer rule into `SQLITE_BUSY` at commit time rather than at begin time.
- **`execFrom` reads, `writeFrom` writes.** Both return the ambient `*sql.Tx` when
  `Store.Do` is active, found through an unexported context key. Outside a transaction
  `execFrom` returns the reader and `writeFrom` returns the writer. The spec sketched one
  accessor; with two pools one accessor would make the reader dead code.
- **Nested `Do` reuses the outer transaction** and opens no savepoint. SQLite has one
  writer, and a nested savepoint would let an inner rollback be swallowed while the outer
  commits — the partial write the unit of work exists to prevent.
- **Migrations run through `goose.NewProvider`, not `goose.UpContext`.** `UpContext` reads
  the package-level filesystem and dialect that `SetBaseFS`/`SetDialect` mutate, which
  races when parallel tests open stores under `-race`.
- **The adiantum key travels as the `hexkey` URI parameter.** The VFS reads it when it
  opens the file, strictly before `journal_mode(WAL)` runs; the PRAGMA form would need SQL
  quoting inside a `_pragma=` value, and a hex string starting with a digit is not a safe
  bare pragma token.
- **The master key lives at `%APPDATA%\Postulator\master.key` via `os.UserConfigDir()`.**
  `xdg.ConfigHome` resolves to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows and would put it elsewhere;
  `xdg` also stays an indirect dependency this way.
- **No `//go:build windows` tags.** The application is Windows-only, `x/sys/windows`
  compiles nowhere else, and a tag would demand a second file that could only be a stub.
- **DPAPI is called with constant application entropy.** A fixed 32-byte literal in
  `adapters/secrets/dpapi` is passed to `CryptProtectData` and `CryptUnprotectData`, so
  any other process running as the same user cannot unprotect our master key by handing
  the blob straight back to DPAPI. The entropy is a compile-time literal, never derived
  at runtime, because changing it orphans every key already on disk. It is part of the
  on-disk format and is frozen from here on.
- **The master key is written atomically.** `writeAtomically` writes `master.key.tmp`,
  `Sync`s, closes and then renames over `master.key`, and removes the temporary file if
  any step fails. A crash can therefore leave a stale `.tmp`, which the next write
  truncates and which `Load` never reads.
- **A key that cannot be unprotected reports `Locked`**, with the message
  `master key cannot be unprotected; remove %APPDATA%\Postulator\master.key to reset`.
  The file is never deleted automatically: the user decides whether to lose every stored
  secret.
- **A panic inside `Store.Do` rolls the transaction back and re-panics.** Leaving the
  `*sql.Tx` open stranded the only writer connection, so every later write blocked until
  its context expired. `Do` also reports `ctx.Err()` when a commit fails on a cancelled
  context, because `sql.ErrTxDone` was surfacing as `Internal` whenever database/sql's own
  rollback beat the commit.
- **Adiantum, WAL and the busy timeout work together.** The Phase 0 open question is
  answered: `TestOpenAppliesPragmas` reports `journal_mode=wal`, `foreign_keys=1`,
  `busy_timeout=5000` and `synchronous=1` on both the plain and the encrypted store, and
  the reader pool is proven to refuse writes.

## Open questions for Phase 1

- The transport error format, the event envelope and whether the TypeScript generator
  survives generics in exported signatures. All three are marked open in
  `docs/CONTRACTS.md` and belong to Phase 1B.

## Known gaps

- `internal/domain`, `internal/application`, `internal/runtime` and `internal/transport`
  do not exist yet. The dependency-rule test skips each rule whose tree is absent and
  starts enforcing it the day the first package lands. The domain+application coverage
  gate reports itself skipped for the same reason, and fails loudly the moment those
  trees hold source that the profile does not cover.
- `lefthook` is not installed on the development machine. Install it with
  `go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest && lefthook install`.
- **`golangci-lint` on this machine must be run from `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.** A scoop
  shim earlier on `PATH` is v2.11.4 built with go1.26 and refuses a `go 1.27` module
  outright. `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.13.2`
  puts the correct binary in `GOPATH/bin`; the shim still wins on `PATH`.
- The frontend is a stub that prints the build info. It is replaced in Phase 11.
